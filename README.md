### ðŸ’ Problem Statement

Grade indicatesÂ the quality and condition of a residence. This strongly influences the homesâ€™ value. The Grade can also be used by existing owners to list their properties for sale. 

To facilitate different requirements of property buyers, real estate companies prefer categorizing various houses into different grades based on various parameters. 

Build a predictive model to determine the Grade of houses (The grades are A,B,C,D, and E).

### ðŸ’ My Approach

As this is a classification problem, I will be utilising supervised machine learning algorithms classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, SVC, and KNN. Additionally, I will also use ensemble classifier models such as Adaboost, XGBoost, Stacking and Random Forest. After utilizing gridsearchCV to optimize the algorithms, the best performing model will be suggested.
